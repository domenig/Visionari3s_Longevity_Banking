# Project Guideline
* **Development tools used to build the project:
  * Back-end: Python (Visual studio). Use of two different APIs to scrape financials and recommendations using Yahoo for the interactive investment bot.
            Also developed a beta version of the interactive investment bot using Interactive Brokers (IBAPI, not used in final project due to limited data access).
  * Front-end: JavaScript. Connected to back-end through Flask.

* **SDKs used:
  * Adobe Dreamweaver.
  * Bootstrap4 (framework).

* APIs used:
  #^  Yahoo Finance API: 2 different ones, to scrape financials and stock recommendations respectively.
  #^  Interactive Brokers API (IBAPI): Used in beta version to feed real-time stock-related data into back-end code. Not used because we could not access the data needed without a private account (hence the switch to Yahoo Finance).

* Datasets with links and a description of how the data has been reused:
  #^  No third-party datasets used: Aside from real-time stock data scraped from Yahoo Finance all was own work.

* Assets used:
  #^  None (all own work, e.g. logo).

* Libraries used:
  #^  Back-end (Python libraries): numpy, pandas, os, flask, csv, datetime, time, io, requests, yfinance, sys (+ own/created libraries).
  #^  Front-end: Adobe XD wireframes components.
  
* Components not created at the Hackathon:
  #^  None.
